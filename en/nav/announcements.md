## <Badge type="tip" text="2024/7/17" /> Apology to All Members

Dear group members (fans),  

After reviewing last night’s chat records, group exits, and feedback, I deeply reflected on the issues. I realize that the fan group should be a space for fans to interact, but there were too many rules causing restrictions. Here are the adjustments:

**1. Simplified Group Rules**  
(1) No discussions involving politics.  
(2) No explicit content.  
(3) No personal insults or arguments.  
(4) Avoid unnecessary spamming; violators will be muted.  
(5) Everyone is equal—group owner, admin, or member.  

**2. Regarding Last Night's Incident**  
I am angry about the malicious insults and regretful for those who left the group. Administrators must enforce equality; repeated violations will result in removal, and new admins will be selected.  

**3. Conclusion**  
I apologize for my delay in addressing this. Thank you all for your support and attention!  

*Sincerely,*  
*汝可知散兵*
*July 17, 2024*
