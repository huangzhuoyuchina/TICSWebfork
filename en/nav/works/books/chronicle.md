# Tyevat Chronicle

## Overview

*Tyevat Chronicle* (Tyevat Language：“<span lang="Teyvat"> Teyvat Chronicle”</span>) is the first edition work written by our institute, primarily documenting the history of the world of *Genshin Impact* from ancient times to the Traveler's era. The book has been in writing since July 2024, during which a large amount of in-game text data was referenced, summarized, supplemented, and verified. We hope that players who are exploring the history of *Genshin Impact* will find some valuable insights within this work.

## Outline

The book has been reprinted several times and has been submitted to miHoYo's secondary creation email for review, but a reply is still awaited.

The first batch of pre-sales for *Tyevat Chronicle* reached its sales target on July 27, 2024. Following that, official purchase channels were paused to ensure the timely delivery of the first batch of books. All first batch books have been successfully delivered and received positive feedback from most Travelers.

Currently, after four successful pre-sales batches, the official website has opened regular purchasing channels.
