—— Teyvat Institute of Culture and Science Announcement Regarding the Sale of *Teyvat Chronicle*

To all staff, researchers, and fans:

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to all our fans for their strong support!

After repeated internal discussions, the institute has decided that starting from November 2, 2024, the price of *Teyvat Chronicle* will be reduced to 26.8 RMB per copy (↓￥6).

As a special thank you to all fans who purchased *Teyvat Chronicle* from October 6 to November 1 (inclusive) in support of our institute, each purchase will come with a special edition voucher for *Genlogy* (￥8.8). Additionally, this batch of *Teyvat Chronicle* will be upgraded to a commemorative edition, featuring the signatures of the main creative team and our institute's leadership. We hope that this commemoration will make *Teyvat Chronicle* a unique memory and bring a warm experience to our fans.

Regarding the price adjustment for this batch of books, in addition to improving print quality in response to reader feedback, it was also a necessary adjustment due to a shortage of funds from the previous batch. We deeply apologize for any inconvenience caused to our fans.

Since the release of *Teyvat Chronicle* (First Edition) by the Teyvat Cultural and Scientific Research Institute's History Department, it has received the attention and support of thousands of loyal fans. As the guardians and promoters of Teyvat’s history and culture, we pour every heartfelt emotion and precious historical record into this work, guiding each traveler through the long river of time to review the past of this continent. The Teyvat Cultural and Scientific Research Institute has always taken it upon itself to promote the Teyvat spirit, never forgetting where we started, staying true to our original intention, and maintaining a deep love for Teyvat's history and culture.

Each slab of stone, each ancient text, and each item in the Teyvat continent is a vivid embodiment of Teyvat's history. Therefore, our mission is not only to uncover these traces left by game developers but also to organize them into a form that is easy for fans to read and understand, so that more fans can benefit from it. We deeply understand that every fan who loves history and culture is our most important partner and the driving force behind the continuation of Teyvat’s story.

For this reason, it is the institute's responsibility to provide more affordable book prices for all fans who love Teyvat's history. We sincerely thank every fan for their support and affection. We understand that bringing Teyvat's history and culture to every person who loves this continent is our greatest honor and achievement. In the future, we will continue to follow the footsteps of history and explore Teyvat’s broader cultural treasures. We will always regard the support of each fan as the most precious source of motivation and strive to bring more touching works and stories to everyone.

Once again, we thank our fans for their support, and we look forward to continuing to accompany each fan on their journey in the future!
