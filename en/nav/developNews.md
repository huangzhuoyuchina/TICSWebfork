## Big Update! Official Website Refactored Again...<Badge type="danger" text="2025/1/17 11:29 (UTC+8)" />

Maybe it doesn't seem like much of a change to you, but I've spent two whole days on it...

Now the website loads faster, and the implementation method has also been changed.

~~(Also, as Ryuun Chou said, the VitePress architecture is indeed shit.)~~

We welcome feedback from all fans so that we can further improve the website.

## The Support to English<Badge type="danger" text="2024/12/19 16:12 (UTC+8)" />

Hello everyone! I'm Pufferfish, the current site programmer.

From now on, this website supports English! 

Just as what Liuyun Cheng has said, please feel free to let me know if you have any feedback of suggestions! Enjoy~

## The Support to Japanese | 日本語対応！<Badge type="danger" text="2024/10/12 01:37 (UTC+8)" />

Hello everyone! I’m Ryuun Chou ✨

This website will soon support Japanese! In fact, Japanese is, just like English, one of the languages I’m most proficient in besides my native language 🎉. Because of this, I’m working hard to ensure that our Japanese friends can enjoy this experience as well! 😄

Please look forward to the finished website! If you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to let me know anytime! I hope for your continued support in the future～🌸

A ton of things have been updated, and honestly, I’m exhausted (（

Seriously, it’s been tiring, hehehe.

I even sacrificed my studies after the National Day holiday to work on this stuff. Sometimes it really gets draining ( But the website’s stability has definitely improved. I also spent some time putting the development environment directly online today because, honestly, the build process with VitePress is absolute crap! Damn, the CSS I wrote turned out to be a mess, and the responsiveness got ruined. It’s really a nightmare, but at least it’s online now. As long as you can see it, I don’t care anymore (（（
